### 4. Provide a brief summary of takeaways from Interim Deliverable-I. These could include key summary statistics tables or plots. 


### This plot shows overlaying denstiy plots for assesment value and closing price. We see that while closing price is generally higher than assesment value, the two are fairly similar. This suggests town assesment value is a reasonable predictor of closing price. 

plot(density(na.exclude(train$price_closed)))
lines(density(na.exclude(train$assessment_value_town)))


###This shows us a scatter plot of square feet plotted against closing price. There appears to be a positive correlation between the two variables.


plot(train$sq_ft_tot_fn, train$price_closed, main = "Scatter Plot of Square Feet vs. Price", ylab = "Closing Price ($),", xlab = "Square Feet (#)")  plot(train$sq_ft_tot_fn, train$price_closed, main = "Scatter Plot of Square Feet vs. Price", ylab = "Closing Price ($),", xlab = "Square Feet (#)") 
 
### This shows us a scatter plot of total bedrooms versus closing price. There seems to be a positive correlation between the two.

plot(train$rooms_total, train$price_closed, main = "Scatter Plot of Square Feet vs. Price", ylab = "Closing Price ($),", xlab = "Total bedrooms (#)") 

### This shows us a scatter plot of total bathrooms versus closing price. There seems to be a positive correlation between the two. 

plot(train$baths_total, train$price_closed, main = "Scatter Plot of # of bathrooms vs. Price", ylab = "Closing Price ($),", xlab = "Bathrooms (#)") 

### This shows us a scatter plot of acres versus closing price. There seems to be a positive correlation between the two. We have adjusted the scale of the x-axis to better see the correlation.

plot(train$acres, train$price_closed, main = "Scatter Plot acres vs. Price", ylab = "Closing Price ($),", xlab = "Acres", xlim = c(0, 350)) 

### Although we thought that the year houses were built would have an impact on the closing prices, we found in our first deliverable that there is little correlation between the age of houses and their closing prices. We found that town assesment value was fairly similar to closing price, suggesting it may be an appropriate explanatory variable. We also found that there is a positive correlation between square feet and price, total bedrooms and closing price, total bathrooms and closing price, and acres and closing price. 

### 6. Determine whether the presence of garage and/or basement affects the assessment
value and closing price for the property. Clearly state the dependent and independent
variables used in your regression analysis. Interpret the findings of this analysis, and
note the R-squared.

BasementVsAssessmentValue = lm(formula = assessment_value_town~factor(basement), data = train)
summary(BasementVsAssessmentValue)

### The independent variable is the presence of the basement, and the dependent variable is assessment value. The coefficient is 169426, meaning that a house with a basement has an assesment value $169236 higher than one without a basement, not considering the other variables. However, the the p-value is 0.334, which means the coefficient is not significant and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that having a basement has no effect on the assessment value of the house. The r-squared is 0.007467, which is the amount of variation in closing price that can be accounted for by presence of a garage. 

BasementVsClosingPrice = lm(formula = price_closed~factor(basement), data = train)
summary(BasementVsClosingPrice)

### The independent variable is the presence of the basement, and the dependent variable is closing price. The coefficient is 31,554, meaning that a house with a basement has an average closing price $31,554 higher than one without a basement, not considering the other variables. The p-value is 0.877582, which means the coefficient is not significant and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that having a basement has no effect on the closing price of the house. The r-squared is 0.0001804, which is the amount of variation in closing price that can be accounted for by presence of a garage. 

GarageVsAssessmentValue = lm(formula = assessment_value_town~factor(garage), data = train)
summary(GarageVsAssessmentValue)

### The independent variable is the presence of the garage, and the dependent variable is assessment value. The coefficient is 259266, meaning that a house with a garage has an assesment value $259266 higher than one without a basement, not considering the other variables. The p-value is 0.0339, meaning this coefficient is significant. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the presence of a garage does not affect the assessment value of a house. The r-squared is .03495, which is the amount of variation in closing price that can be accounted for by presence of a garage. 

GarageVsClosingPrice = lm(formula = price_closed~factor(garage), data = train)
summary(GarageVsClosingPrice)

### The independent variable is the presence of the garage, and the dependent variable is closing price. The coefficient is 292397, meaning that a house with a garage has a closing price $292397 higher than one without a basement, not considering the other variables. The p-value is 0.0333, meaning this coefficient is significant. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the presence of a garage does not affect the closing price of a house. The r-squared is .03311, which is the amount of variation in closing price that can be accounted for by presence of a garage. 

5. Compare the mean assessment price and closing prices by the presence of garage or basement in the property. Clearly mention the type of two-sample t-test you would be using, the null and alternate hypotheses for these tests. Interpret the results of these t- tests.

```{r}
Closing_v_Estimate = subset(train, select=c("id", "assessment_value_town", "price_closed"))
Closing_v_Estimate$isGarage = train$garage
Closing_v_Estimate$isBasement = train$basement
summary(Closing_v_Estimate)

ttestdata = Closing_v_Estimate[complete.cases(Closing_v_Estimate), ]
summary(ttestdata)
```
### Before we were able to conduct analysis, we created a new dataset that ommitted any rows with missing data (NAs). There were 10 rows with missing data. To ensure that ommitting the data did not impact the data in a drastic way, we compared the summary statistics between the two data sets. The median values of both the assessment values and the closing prices remained the same. The mean assessment value increased by 0.76% and the mean closing price decreased by 0.49% -- neighther change great enough to raise red flags about impacting ttest results. 

```{r}
t.test(ttestdata[ttestdata$isGarage == "Yes",]$price_closed, ttestdata[ttestdata$isGarage == "No",]$price_closed)
```
### We ran an Independent Samples t-test because we are comparing the same variable, closing price, between two sub-samples, houses with garages and houses without garages. Our null hypothesis was that there is no difference in closing prices between houses with garages and houses without garages. The results of our t-test show that we can reject our null hypothesis and state that, with more than 99% confidence, the alternative hypothesis, which says the difference in average closing price between houses with and without garages is not 0, is true (p<.001). This means there is most likely a significant difference between the closing prices of houses with and without garages, with the mean of houses with garages being significantly more than the mean of houses without garages.  

```{r}
t.test(ttestdata[ttestdata$isBasement == "Yes",]$price_closed, ttestdata[ttestdata$isBasement == "No",]$price_closed)
```
### To test whether or not houses with basements had significantly higher closing prices than houses without basements, we ran another Independent Samples t-test. Our null hypothesis was that there is no difference in closing price between houses with and without basements. The results of our t-test show that we cannot reject the null with 95% confidence, meaning there is no significant difference between the closing price of houses with and without basements (p>.05).

```{r}
t.test(ttestdata[ttestdata$isGarage == "Yes",]$assessment_value_town, ttestdata[ttestdata$isGarage == "No",]$assessment_value_town)
```
### Just as there was a significant difference in the closing price between houses with and without garages, there is a significant difference in town assessment value between houses with and without garages. To determine this, we ran an Indepenent Samples t-test for which our null hypothesis was that there is no significant difference assessment value between houses with and without garages. The results of our t-test show that we can reject the null and accept the alternative hypothesis, which states that the difference in average assessment values between houses with and without garages is not zero, with 95% confidence (p<.05). This means in terms of the real estate business that the town does take the presence of garages into account when determining the assessment value of houses and values houses with garages significantly higher, on average, than houses without garages. 

```{r}
t.test(ttestdata[ttestdata$isBasement == "Yes",]$assessment_value_town, ttestdata[ttestdata$isBasement == "No",]$assessment_value_town)
```
### Last, we checked to see if there exists a significant difference in the town assessment values of houses with and without basements. We used an Independent Samples t-test for which our null hypothesis was that there is no significant difference between the assessment values. The t-test showed that we are not able to reject the null with 95% confidence, meaning town assessers of house values most likely do not take the existance of a basement into account when coming outt with the value of the house (p>.05).

###OTHER RELEVANT CODE TO PUT IN RMARKDOWN

###CLEAN DATA

### we should run this for acres before we do all analysis:

train[128,4] = 4.79
train[58, 4] = .54

### when we need to run specific analysis using variables where just a few columns of data are missing, use the following code to delete rows:

nameNewDataFrame = subset(train, train$id!= _______) ... insert rows you want to omit from new dataframe
Clean_Garage_Cap = subset(train, train$id!= 128)

###DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOWN ESTIMATE AND CLOSING PRICE

Closing_v_Estimate = subset(train, select=c("id", "assessment_value_town", "price_closed"))
Closing_v_Estimate$difference = Closing_v_Estimate$assessment_value_town - Closing_v_Estimate$price_closed

### there are 6 estimates that are over $1,000,000 off and over 50 estimates that are over $100,000 off.
